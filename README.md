# PyBer_Analysis
** ****Project Overview******


In this Project we have given a ride sharing data. By analyzing this data we should create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. We should create a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

** **Results****

[Summary Dataframe]<img width="625" alt="Summary" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71113701/97793456-15e30a80-1bba-11eb-965a-8b837134701a.png">



*The dataframe summary for ridesharing tells us a many important things. There are  more rides in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural. The number of drivers also follows that same pattern with more drivers being in Urban cities. The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are actully most expensive in the rural areas and cheaper in the Urban cities. This points out that as a ride share service has more drivers available the ride fares become cheaper on average. However, it is important to note that a missing piece of crucial data is the length of the ride. Its possible that since rural areas might require longer rides, that the data is skewed by the duration of the ride causing an increase in fares.

*The multiline graph gives a nice visualiation of the ride share data. It clearly shows that all city types (Urban, Suburban, and Rural) are fairly consistent in total fares over time. There are a few spikes in the data here and there but overall quite consistent. It also shows that the majority of the money comes from Urban cities followed by Suburban and Rural last... It is clear from both of the summary dataframe and graph that even though the average fair of a Rural ride is higher, more money is made from Urban rides in total.

**Summary**

1.If  ride share service has more drivers available then ride fares become cheaper on average.so increase the number of drivers in rural areas that way fare per ride will be cheaper.

2.Since people in Urban  city type are using ride service more frequently you can increase average fare per ride a little bit more .

3.In suburban city type, decrease average fare per ride a little bit so more people in suburban city type will start using this ride service.
